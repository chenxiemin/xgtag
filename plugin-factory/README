This directory is a factory of plug-in parsers.

How to write a plug-in parser?
==============================

You should write a parser function like follows:

#include "parser.h"
void
parser(const struct parser_param *param)
{
        ...
}

A param argument is given to each parser function.
You can write a tag using the param argument like follows:

o write a tag to GTAGS

	param->put(PARSER_DEF, <tag name>, <line no>, <file name>, <line image>, param->arg);

o write a tag to GRTAGS

	param->put(PARSER_REF_SYM, <tag name>, <line no>, <file name>, <line image>, param->arg);

Note: 
Gtags always makes GRTAGS even if you don't use PARSER_REF_SYM.
This is an example of plug-in parser for gtags(1).

How to use Exuberant Ctags parser?
==================================

The parser 'exuberant-ctags.la' is built as a shared library, and is installed to
/usr/local/lib/gtags by default.

To use this parser, please do like follows:
(It assumed that Exuberant ctags exists in "/usr/local/bin".)

	$ ./configure --with-exuberant-ctags=/usr/local/bin/ctags
	$ make install
	$ gtags --gtagsconf=/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf --gtagslabel=ctags
